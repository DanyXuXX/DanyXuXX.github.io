The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role when the virus enters the host, and
small mutations at spike protein may lead to very prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strands. Building
a phylogenetic tree on the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can serve as a
classification model on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants. Based on the classification
results, we used protein simulation to construct the structures of the spike protein variants
and obtained the similarity and difference of protein structures. By analyzing the
phylogenetic tree and comparing it to the results from protein simulation similarities, we
found some moderate correlations between the spike protein sequence variance and its
structure. However, there may be some 
flaws in our data and measurements, so we may
not reach a conclusive statement.
