Cytochrome P450 enzymes are very important in steroid biosynthesis and drug metabolism
in human and natural product biosynthesis pathways.
By building a classification/prediction model on the functions of P450 enzymes, we
can better understand their behavior and classify them based on their functions for newly
discovered P450 enzymes. This project builds classification models of the hydroxylation
function of proteins in P450 family using K nearest model and depth first search for
their neighbors in connectivity graphs based on their pairwise alignment scores. We also
examined the prediction accuracy of models and we try to add additional features that
boost prediction accuracy.
