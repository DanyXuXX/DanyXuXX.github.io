I am currently a master student of the [Master of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/master-biomedical-informatics) program at Harvard Medical School with expectation to graduate after 2023 Fall. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2022 Spring at Carnegie Mellon University in Computer Science. During the time, I have also completed a minor in mathematical sciences and a concentration in computational biology. My research interests mostly focus on using computational methods on genomics data and biological pathways to make scientific discoveries in chemical biology, immunology, and therapeutics.
