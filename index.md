I am currently a student of the Master of Science in Computer Engineering program at New York University, US. Previously, I have completed Bachelor's of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Southeast University, China. 

I possess fundamental knowledge and research studies in AI-related fields, as well as enough project experiences covering AI applications, data analyzing and Python development with proficiency in languages like Python, C++, and Java, as well as tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. My interests lie in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP, where I constantly strive to improve results by integrating state-of-art models. Additionally, I am skilled in database management across SQL and NoSQL environments.
