The TCGA dataset is comprised of a variety of patient
sample information collected by many project. The project
TCGA-MSEO in particular focused on mesothelioma, a
type of cancer which mostly arises in the mesothelial surfaces
of tissues in the pleura. In this project, sample information,
gene expression level, and mutation variants
information associated with the disease are collected by
the TCGA-MESO project, providing the foundation of this
study. We conducted principle component analysis and
clustering to see if there are correlation between the gene
expression data and mutational variants on the general
level.
