I am currently a master student of the [Master of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/master-biomedical-informatics) program at Harvard Medical School with expectation to graduate after 2023 Fall. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2022 Spring at Carnegie Mellon University in Computer Science. During the time, I have also completed a minor in mathematical sciences and a concentration in computational biology. I am interested in mathematical models, machine learning, genomics and therapeutics. One thing in particular is to use mathematical models and computational methods to study gene regulations, molecular pathways, and signaling networks.
