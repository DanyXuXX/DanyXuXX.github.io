  Conserved across multiple species and cell-types throughout evolution, TADs offer an insight
into functional elements in the genome as there are evidence suggesting that all TADs represent
functional domains...

Topologically associating domains (TAD) are self-interacting genomic domains. They are usually
captured using genome-wide techniques such as Hi-C. Recently, TADs have gained increasing
research interest, as new insights into the human genome structures have driven many discoveries
of the underlying mechanisms of genetic expressions, functions, and diseases. In the 2018 paper
Quantifying the similarity of topological domains across normal and cancer human cell types,
Sauerwald and Kingsford analyzed the similarities of the superstructures between cancer and
normal cells using the Armatus TAD caller, which as they argued, was one of the best tools
available. We compared a range of TAD callers with a set of various metrics to see whether the
same results can be replicated for HiCseg, Armatus, and the most recent spectralTAD.
